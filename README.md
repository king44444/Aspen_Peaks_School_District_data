# Alpine School District - Salary Analysis Dashboard

*Created by Michael King*

A comprehensive Streamlit web application for analyzing employee salary data from Alpine School District. This tool provides detailed insights into salary distribution, equity analysis, and compensation patterns across different roles and functional areas.

**üö® 2024 Update:** This analysis is particularly critical as it represents the final year before Alpine School District undergoes significant reorganization and potential district splitting. The 2024 data provides crucial baseline insights for community stakeholders.

## üìä Data Source & Methodology

### Data Source
All salary data in this analysis comes directly from **Utah's official transparency portal** at [transparent.utah.gov](https://transparent.utah.gov). This ensures the underlying financial information is accurate and represents official state records of public employee compensation.

### Important Disclaimer
While the raw salary data is official state information, the **classification and grouping of employees into functional areas** (such as "Instruction," "Administration," etc.) represents the author's interpretation based on job titles and descriptions. These categorizations, while systematic and logical, may not perfectly align with the district's internal organizational structure. Users should consider these groupings as analytical tools rather than official district classifications.

### Geographic Context
This analysis focuses on **Alpine School District** salary data, with an optional filter for **Aspen Peaks District** schools. The Aspen Peaks filter represents a geographic subset of schools within the Alpine School District boundaries, specifically those serving the communities around American Fork, Lehi, Highland, and surrounding areas.

## üìà Data Structure

The application expects a CSV file with the following key columns:
- `employee_name`: Employee identifier
- `title`: Job title/position
- `net_amount`: Salary amount
- `org2`: School/organization assignment
- `description`: Additional role description
- `fiscal_year`: Year of data

## üîç Analysis Methodology

### Employee Classification Logic
Employees are automatically classified into functional areas based on keywords in job titles and descriptions. This classification system was developed by analyzing common patterns in the data:

**Instruction**
- Keywords: "teacher", "cert" (certified)
- Examples: "Elementary Teacher", "Secondary Teacher", "Certified Instructor"

**School Administration**
- Keywords: "principal", "school admin"
- Examples: "Elementary Principal", "Assistant Principal"

**District Administration**
- Keywords: "superintendent", "director", "district admin", "board"
- Examples: "Superintendent", "District Director", "Board Member"

**Student Support**
- Keywords: "counselor", "psychologist", "speech"
- Examples: "School Counselor", "Speech Therapist", "School Psychologist"

**Operations & Maintenance**
- Keywords: "custodian", "maintenance", "facilities"
- Examples: "Head Custodian", "Maintenance Worker", "Facilities Manager"

**Transportation**
- Keywords: "transport"
- Examples: "Bus Driver", "Transportation Supervisor"

**Food Services**
- Keywords: "food", "nutrition"
- Examples: "Kitchen Manager", "Nutrition Assistant"

**Other**
- Any employee not fitting the above categories

### FTE Classification
Full-time equivalent (FTE) status determined by job title keywords:
- **Non-FTE**: Contains "hourly", "substitute", "part-time", or "temp"
- **FTE**: All other employees

### Statistical Measures
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of salary variability within roles
- **Coefficient of Variation**: Normalized measure of salary equity (lower = more equitable)
- **Quartiles**: 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentile salary ranges
- **Salary Range**: Difference between minimum and maximum salaries

### Data Limitations & Interpretation Guidelines

**Strengths of This Analysis:**
- Based on official state salary data
- Comprehensive coverage of all district employees
- Systematic classification methodology
- Multiple analytical perspectives (role, geography, FTE status)

**Limitations to Consider:**
- Employee classifications are interpretive, not official district categories
- Job titles may not fully reflect actual responsibilities
- Part-time vs. full-time distinctions based on title keywords only
- No adjustment for experience, education, or certification levels
- Geographic school assignments may not perfectly match community boundaries

**Best Practices for Interpretation:**
- Use salary ranges and medians rather than focusing on individual outliers
- Compare similar-sized employee groups for meaningful insights
- Consider the context that education compensation includes benefits not captured here
- Cross-reference findings with official district budget documents when possible

## üéØ Use Cases

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Functional Areas
Modify the `classify()` function in `app.py` to add new employee categories:

```python
def classify(row):
    title = row['title'].lower()
    if "new_role" in title:
        return "New Category"
    # ... existing logic
```

### Adjusting School Lists
Update the `aspen_peaks_schools` list to modify geographic filtering:

```python
aspen_peaks_schools = [
    "Your School Name",
    # ... other schools
]
```

### Modifying Visualizations
All charts can be customized by modifying the matplotlib/seaborn parameters in the respective sections.

## üìä Understanding the Results

### Most Reliable Insights
- **Total compensation by functional area**: High confidence due to direct data aggregation
- **Employee count distributions**: Accurate representation of workforce composition
- **Salary ranges within roles**: Good indicator of pay equity and structure

### Insights Requiring Caution
- **Individual employee classifications**: May not match official district organization
- **Comparisons between very different roles**: Context matters (education, experience, responsibilities)
- **Geographic analysis**: School assignments may not perfectly reflect community served

### Contextual Considerations
- **Total Compensation**: The figures shown include both salaries and employee benefits (approximately 70% salary, 30% benefits based on sample data analysis)
- Teacher salaries typically follow structured pay scales based on education and experience
- Administrative roles may have different compensation structures and expectations
- Seasonal and substitute workers create natural salary distribution patterns

## üìä Sample Data

The repository includes sample data (`data/sample_data.txt`) for testing purposes. This contains a subset of the full dataset structure to help understand the expected format without using actual employee information.

## üìã Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for a complete list of Python dependencies:
- streamlit
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## üìù License & Usage

This project is intended for educational and transparency purposes. The analysis methodology and code are freely available for adaptation to other school districts or public sector organizations.

**Data Privacy Compliance**: When using this tool with actual salary data, ensure compliance with local data privacy laws, public records regulations, and ethical guidelines for handling employee information.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"streamlit command not found"**
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

**"No module named 'seaborn'"**
```bash
pip install seaborn matplotlib pandas
```

**Data loading errors**
- Ensure CSV file is in `data/` directory
- Check that column names match expected format (`employee_name`, `title`, `net_amount`, `org2`, `description`)
- Verify file encoding (should be UTF-8)

**Performance issues with large datasets**
- Large datasets may require increased memory allocation
- Consider filtering data before analysis for files with >50,000 records
- Use the geographic filter to focus on smaller subsets for initial analysis

**Classification seems incorrect**
- Review the `classify()` function logic in `app.py`
- Consider that job titles may not perfectly reflect roles
- Classifications are interpretive tools, not definitive categorizations

### Getting Help
- Check the Streamlit documentation: https://docs.streamlit.io/
- Review matplotlib documentation for chart customization: https://matplotlib.org/
- Open an issue in this repository for specific problems
- For data interpretation questions, consider consulting with district HR or finance departments
